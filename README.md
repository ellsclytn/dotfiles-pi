**Configuration files and scripts for my Raspberry Pi**

---

## Wat 📝

I'm aiming to get as much of the configuration Dockerised as possible. Currently, this includes:

* PiHole
* Syncthing
* OpenVPN
* Sonarr (routed through OpenVPN)
* Deluge (routed through OpenVPN)

## TODO 🛠

* Put all my ZSH and Vim config in here
